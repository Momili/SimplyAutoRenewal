                <p>Renewing items on Etsy is the key to making your shop more visible to customers.</p>
                <p> Recently renewed items appear first in product search results and category pages.</p>                
                <p>SIMPLY AUTO RENEWAL makes this process a breeze by enabling you to schedule item renewals in advance and by freeing you from the need to sit at your computer and constantly click renew.</p>
                <p>Sellers can automatically schedule their listings without having to log into Etsy.</p>
                <p>Renew specific items, most viewed items, about to expire items, random items or items based on keywords.</p>
                <p>Schedule renewals at a specific time zone, date and time.</p>
                <p>Set items to renew at certain timed intervals to repeat forever.</p>
                <p>It's free for the first month and only $4.00 USD per month afterwards.</p>
                <p>Give it a try and let us know what you think?</p>
                <p>We'd love to hear your feedback.</p>				
                <p>Cheers and Happy Sales,</p>
